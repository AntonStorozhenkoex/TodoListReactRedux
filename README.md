# My React + Redux App 
Today I developed my first JavaScript Todo application using the React library.
## My application can:

#####  - Add a new task
#####  - Delete task
#####  - Change task status (completed / in progress)
####   - Filter tasks by status (all / completed / in progress)
####   - Delete completed tasks
